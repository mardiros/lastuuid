"""
Utilities methods that may be used for database querying purpose.

Because UUIDv7 are timestamped ordered and monotonically increasing,
there are a good solution for generating primary keys.

The design of UUIDv7 feet well with the design of BTree.

Because they contains a date time, a UUID range can be compute
in order to retrieve UUIDs generated at a given time.


```{important}
In a distributed system, relying solely on a datetime or UUIDv7 for sorting
has limitations.
While UUIDv7 ensures sequential ordering on a single machine, there is no guarantee
that a UUIDv7 generated later on one machine will be greater than one generated
earlier on another machine.

This documentation does not cover the book Designing Data-Intensive Applications ;).
